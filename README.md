# Crop Yield Analysis
This project analyzes crop yield data from various farms, exploring factors like farm size, irrigation type, soil type, fertilizer and pesticide use, and seasonal variations. The objective is to identify patterns that impact crop yield efficiency.

## Key Insights
- The farmlands support a decent variety of crops with over 100 kg/acre yield.
- Sprinkler and Manual irrigation resulted in better yields than Flood irrigation.
- Farms with Loamy and Peaty soils had higher yields than those with Clay or Silty soils.
- Kharif and Zaid seasons showed different yield patterns, likely due to rainfall and temperature.
- Higher fertilizer and pesticide use did not always lead to better yields.
- Farms with better water efficiency achieved higher yields, suggesting the need for optimized irrigation.

## Recommendations

1. Encourage optimal irrigation methods such as Sprinkler systems to improve efficiency.


2. Prioritize high-yield crops like Tomato and Carrot in favorable conditions.


3. Optimize fertilizer and pesticide application based on crop needs to reduce costs and environmental impact.


4. Promote soil testing to match crops with the most suitable soil types.


5. Analyze seasonal patterns further to adjust planting schedules for maximum yield.


6. Implement water management strategies to reduce waste and improve sustainability.



## Techniques & Procedures

Data Import & Cleaning: Imported raw data into Excel.

Pivot Table Analysis: Used pivot tables to analyze yield variations based on farm size, irrigation type, soil type, fertilizer use, and season.

Comparative Analysis: Compared different crop types and input levels to identify trends.

Visualization: Created charts to illustrate key insights (if applicable).
