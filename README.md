## Key Insights
- Farmlands support diverse crops with 100+ kg/acre yields.
- Rainfall remains the most effective irrigation method.
- Loamy soil boosts sugarcane yield, while peaty soil favours carrots.
- Zaid season supports a wider crop variety with strong yields.
- More fertilizer/pesticides don’t always mean better yields—soil testing and expert supervision are key.

## Recommendation
1. Optimize irrigation with Drip and Sprinkler systems for better efficiency.
2. Prioritize high-yield crops like Sugarcane, Carrot, and Tomato in ideal conditions.
3. Apply fertilizers/pesticides base on crop needs to cut costs and impact.
4. Promote soil testing for better crop-soil matching.
5. Study seasonal patterns to optimize planting schedules.
