# Crop Yield Analysis
This project analyzes crop yield data from various farms, exploring factors like farm size, irrigation type, soil type, fertilizer and pesticide use, and seasonal variations. The objective is to identify patterns that impact crop yield efficiency.

## Key Insights
- The farmlands support a decent variety of crops with over 100 kg/acre yields.
- While other irrigation methods prove useful, rainfall remains the best.
- Farms with Loamy and Peaty soils had higher yields especially for sugarcane and carrots respectively.
- The Zaid season supports a wider variety of crops with most yielding over a hundred kg/acre.
- Higher fertilizer and pesticide use did not always lead to better yields. There's the need to assess soils for specific nutrients need or ensure expert supervision during applications.

## Recommendations
1. Optimize irrigation methods such as Drip and Sprinkler systems to improve efficiency.
2. Prioritize high-yield crops like Tomato and Carrot in favourable conditions.
3. Optimize fertilizer and pesticide application based on crop needs to reduce costs and environmental impact.
4. Promote soil testing to match crops with the most suitable soil types.
5. Analyze seasonal patterns further to adjust planting schedules for maximum yield.


## Techniques & Procedures

#### Data Import and Cleaning:
The dataset contains 10 features, including "Crop_Type", "Farm_Area", "Irrigation_Type", "Fertilizer_Used", and "Yield" among others, with 50 records. It was imported into Excel as a single table. Upon review, no missing data and no duplicate records were identified.

#### Pivot Table Analysis:
Used pivot tables to analyze yield variations based on crop type, irrigation type, soil type, season, fertilizer and pesticide use.




Comparative Analysis: Compared different crop types and input levels to identify trends.

Visualization: Created charts to illustrate key insights (if applicable).
