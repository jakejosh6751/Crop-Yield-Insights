# Crop Yield Analysis
This project analyzes crop yield data from various farms, exploring factors like farm size, irrigation type, soil type, fertilizer and pesticide use, and seasonal variations. The objective is to identify patterns that impact crop yield efficiency.

## Key Insights

Crop Performance: Some crops, such as Tomato and Carrot, show higher yields compared to others like Cotton and Sugarcane, possibly due to input efficiency.

Irrigation Methods: Sprinkler and Manual irrigation appear to support higher yields, while Flood irrigation is associated with lower yield efficiency.

Soil Type Impact: Farms with Loamy and Peaty soils have generally better yields than those with Clay or Silty soils.

Seasonal Effects: Kharif and Zaid seasons show different yield patterns, possibly due to variations in rainfall and temperature.

Input Usage: Higher fertilizer and pesticide usage does not always correlate with better yield; some crops perform well with lower inputs.

Water Usage: Farms with higher water efficiency tend to achieve better yields, indicating potential for optimized irrigation strategies.


## Recommendations

1. Encourage optimal irrigation methods such as Sprinkler systems to improve efficiency.


2. Prioritize high-yield crops like Tomato and Carrot in favorable conditions.


3. Optimize fertilizer and pesticide application based on crop needs to reduce costs and environmental impact.


4. Promote soil testing to match crops with the most suitable soil types.


5. Analyze seasonal patterns further to adjust planting schedules for maximum yield.


6. Implement water management strategies to reduce waste and improve sustainability.



## Techniques & Procedures

Data Import & Cleaning: Imported raw data into Excel.

Pivot Table Analysis: Used pivot tables to analyze yield variations based on farm size, irrigation type, soil type, fertilizer use, and season.

Comparative Analysis: Compared different crop types and input levels to identify trends.

Visualization: Created charts to illustrate key insights (if applicable).
